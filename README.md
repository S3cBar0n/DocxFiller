<h2>Automatic New Hire Letter Generator</h2>

This is an edited and modified copy of the one I created for automation at my work, all identifying information has been removed or modified. 

For privacy and security, the letter templates and dictionaries have been removed.

The letters will need tables to run properly, that is how the docx package targets what fields to fill.

In addition, this program is tailored to the environment it was built for, without very slight modifications your results will vary.


<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creates letters for users who have been created within AD and contain a display name + office line.</li>
    <li>Letters are generated for users who have existed for less than 30 days</li>
    <li>Has logic to reset users passwords and generates passwords between 35-45 characters</li>
    <li>Sets password reset instructions for most titles</li>
    <li>Knows how many letters exist for a specific user and will create one if both do not exist</li>
</ul>

<h3>Please note, this program will not be able to create or set a password for the letter if the users have already had a password change.</h3>

I will gladly answer any questions, dm me.
